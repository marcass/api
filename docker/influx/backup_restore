to backup and restore versions of influx db must match (what a nightmare)

Steps to restore:
1. ensure influx is running and listening on 8088:

We need to have a common network (i think):
docker network create -d bridge influx

We need to set the environment variable for the bind address (see -e option)
We need to make sure it is the latest (backup was made in influxdb version 1.7.2)
We need to have our volume mounted to spinning disk (lots of writes)
Following is an example of a container running influx that will receive a backup (be restored):

docker run --network=vexme -p 8088:8088 -p 8086:8086 -e INFLUXDB_BIND_ADDRESS=":8088" -v influx:/var/lib/influxdb influxdb:latest

An example of a Dockerfile that will set the restore up is this:

FROM influxdb:latest
RUN mkdir -p /backup   #this makes a dir to dump backup to (from local file system)
COPY ./influx/* /backup/ #this copies the backup to the image
CMD influxd restore -portable -host 172.18.0.2:8088 /backup/ #this is the command that will do the restore to the running influxdb container
                                                              # change the ip to the docker inflxudb's ip address (find by docker inspect <influxdb containter id>)
To build (in the directory contaiing the above Dockerfile):
docker build -f ./influx_restore -t myinfluxdb:restore .

docker run -rm --network=vexme <container id>
