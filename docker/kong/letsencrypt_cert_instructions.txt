If you want kong to be contacted directly it needs letsencrypt certs for oauth to use (not to mention to secure it

I will prob use nginx as forwarder installed on host though

To test need to run the following with port 80 mapped to the host machine:
docker run -p 80:80 -h kong-certbot-agent --network=kong_kong-net -it --rm phpdockerio/kong-certbot-agent     ./certbot-agent certs:update     --test-cert     http://kong:8001 best.nose@gmail.com skibo.duckdns.org

If not testing (rather renewing) remove hte --test-cert
Ensure service and routes set up as explained in:
